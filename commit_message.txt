feat: Major Refactor and UI Overhaul

This commit introduces a significant architectural refactor and a complete user interface overhaul to improve the application's performance, maintainability, and user experience.

Key changes include:

- **Data Model Refactoring**: Merged the `schedules` and `series_items` tables into a single `series` table to simplify the data model and align with business logic. Renamed `application_number` to `schedule_number` for consistency.

- **Enhanced Search and Filtering**: Rebuilt the search and filtering system to use IndexedDB indexes for faster performance. The new system supports multi-term text search and advanced filtering by date ranges, tags, and retention categories.

- **UI/UX Overhaul**: Redesigned the entire user interface with a modern aesthetic, including:
  - Light and dark mode support.
  - Improved layout and responsiveness.
  - Enhanced accessibility with ARIA attributes.

- **Code Quality**: Improved code quality and maintainability by:
  - Introducing utility classes for error handling, input sanitization, and DOM manipulation.
  - Adding a `function_review.txt` file to streamline the code review process.

- **Database Migration**: Implemented a database migration strategy to ensure a seamless transition for existing users to the new data model (v4).
